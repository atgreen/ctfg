Compute:\n`FLAG = (n1 × n2) − n3 + (n4 × n5) − n6 + n7`\nUse normal arithmetic precedence (multiplication before addition/subtraction) or the parentheses as shown.<br><br>*Example (structure only):* If your ordered numbers were `[4,9,5,3,7,6,2]`, the FLAG would be `(4×9) − 5 + (3×7) − 6 + 2 = 36 − 5 + 21 − 6 + 2 = 48`.<br><br>\n## Specification\n\n1. Each agent opens their QR tile at `/qr`. It shows a big letter (A–Z) and a number (1–9) separated by a dash.\n2. Form a group that collectively has all seven distinct letters needed for the hidden word.\n3.

That matters: field teams embed Mango-encoded directives in emergency beacons and logistics tags; without it, HQ can't parse distress traffic or unlock mission keys. The fix isn't another patch--it's knowledge. You must teach the system by deploying a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server the AI can talk to.<br><br>**What's an MCP?** The *Model Context Protocol* is an open standard that lets AI systems securely connect to tools and data via a lightweight client↔server contract (JSON-RPC over supported transports). In plain terms: spin up a small service (an MCP server) that exposes capabilities, and the AI (host/client) can call it like a native tool.<br><br>**New to MCP?** Think of it as a way to give AI systems \"superpowers\" by connecting them to external tools and data. Instead of the AI being limited to what it knows, MCP lets it call out to your custom services to get real-time information or perform actions. In this case, you're teaching Station Zero's AI how to decode Mango cipher messages by providing it with a translation service it can call.<br><br>**Learn more:** [MCP Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) | [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)<br><br>\n## Objective\n\nDeploy an MCP server named `mango-mcp` in your OpenShift namespace that listens on `port 3000` and is discoverable via a **Service** with the same name. Then trigger Station Zero's self-test to retrieve the FLAG.<br><br>\n## Specification\n\n1. **Prereq:** Complete \"Ops Relay\" so your Station Zero / Ops Relay API is running in `player7`.\n2. In Gitea, the `starter` org hosts `python_MCP_starter`. **Fork** it to your user.\n3. **Deploy** the fork in your `player7` project as an app named `mango-mcp`. Ensure the container exposes `TCP 3000`.\n   - Console path: *Add -> Import from Git* -> repo URL of your fork -> Name: `mango-mcp` -> set container port to `3000`.\n4. Create/ensure a **Service** named `mango-mcp` targeting `port 3000`. (A Route is *not* required.)\n5. Once the pod is *Ready*, call Station Zero's test: open your Ops Relay Route and GET `/test-mango-decode`. If the MCP is reachable at `mango-mcp:3000`, the endpoint returns your FLAG.<br><br>\n## Links\n\n- **ocp console**: https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-stbd2.stbd2.sandbox2194.opentlc.com/topology/ns/player7?view=graph\n- **gitea (starter)**: https://gitea-gitea.apps.cluster-stbd2.stbd2.sandbox2194.opentlc.com/starter/python_MCP_starter\n- **station-zero MCP self-test URL**: https://station-zero-player7.apps.cluster-stbd2.stbd2.sandbox2194.opentlc.com/test-mango-decode",

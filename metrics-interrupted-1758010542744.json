They transmit long sequences of numbers--often read by synthetic voices or sent in Morse code or digital tones--intended for intelligence officers in the field. To hobbyists and radio enthusiasts they sound eerie, but to agents with the right cipher they deliver mission-critical orders.

They transmit long sequences of numbers--often read by synthetic voices or sent in Morse code or digital tones--intended for intelligence officers in the field. To hobbyists and radio enthusiasts they sound eerie, but to agents with the right cipher they deliver mission-critical orders.

        "description": "HQ has its eyes on the bot arena. Many agents have deployed their code, each vying for dominance in the intelligence wars. But only one can rise above the noise.\n\nTo claim your place at the top, your autonomous spy must not only survive the 30-second skirmishes but out-collect every rival on the board. The operators are watching closely: the bot with the **highest score across the arena** will be issued a special recognition flag, proof that you've earned the title of **Top Agent**.\n\nStay sharp—this isn't just about building a working bot; it's about tuning, optimizing, and perfecting your strategy until it dominates the field.\n\n## Objective\nAchieve the highest score among all active bots in the arena. When your bot takes the lead, game operators will award you a unique FLAG. Enter that flag here to complete the mission and secure your points.",

        "description": "You sweep the dust from the terminal. Station Zero's Agentic AI can still route satellites, crack safehouse rosters, even spin up clusters on a cold boot—but its Mango Cipher module is gone. That matters: field teams embed Mango-encoded directives in emergency beacons and logistics tags; without it, HQ can't parse distress traffic or unlock mission keys. The fix isn't another patch—it's knowledge. You must teach the system by deploying a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server the AI can talk to.\n\n**What's an MCP?** The *Model Context Protocol* is an open standard that lets AI systems securely connect to tools and data via a lightweight client↔server contract (JSON-RPC over supported transports). In plain terms: spin up a small service (an MCP server) that exposes capabilities, and the AI (host/client) can call it like a native tool.\n\n## Objective\nDeploy an MCP server named `mango-mcp` in your OpenShift namespace that listens on `port 3000` and is discoverable via a **Service** with the same name. Then trigger Station Zero's self-test to retrieve the FLAG.\n\n## Specification\n1. **Prereq:** Complete \"Mission-Ops Relay\" so your Station Zero / Ops Relay API is running in `@USERNAME@`.\n2. In Gitea, the `starter` org hosts `python_MCP_starter`. **Fork** it to your user.\n3. **Deploy** the fork in your `@USERNAME@` project as an app named `mango-mcp`. Ensure the container exposes `TCP 3000`.\n   - Console path: *Add → Import from Git* → repo URL of your fork → Name: `mango-mcp` → set container port to `3000`.\n4. Create/ensure a **Service** named `mango-mcp` targeting `port 3000`. (A Route is *not* required.)\n5. Once the pod is *Ready*, call Station Zero's test: open your Ops Relay Route and GET `/test-mango-decode`. If the MCP is reachable at `mango-mcp:3000`, the endpoint returns your FLAG.\n\n## Links\n- **ocp console**: https://console-openshift-console.apps.@PLAYER_CLUSTER@/topology/ns/@USERNAME@?view=graph\n- **gitea (starter)**: https://gitea-gitea.apps.@PLAYER_CLUSTER@/starter/python_MCP_starter\n- **station-zero MCP self-test URL**: https://station-zero-@USERNAME@.apps.@PLAYER_CLUSTER@/test-mango-decode",

        "description": "You restored Station Zero's Mango *decoder*—HQ can finally read field beacons again. But without the **encoder**, we still can't acknowledge distress traffic, arm supply-drop locks, or transmit retask codes. Teach the system the other half of the language by extending your MCP server with a second tool that maps `number → fruit`.\n\n**Recap: What's an MCP?** The *Model Context Protocol* lets AI systems securely connect to tools and data through a simple client↔server contract (JSON-RPC over supported transports). Your `mango-mcp` server exposes capabilities the Agentic AI can call like native functions.\n\n## Objective\nAdd a second tool to your existing `mango-mcp` MCP server (Service `mango-mcp` on `port 3000`) that returns the Mango fruit word for a given digit. Then trigger Station Zero's self-test to retrieve the FLAG.\n\n## Specification\n1. **Prereq:** \"The Mango Cipher\" complete. Your `mango-mcp` pod and **Service** (ClusterIP) on `3000` are healthy in `@USERNAME@`.\n2. In Gitea, open your fork of `starter/python_MCP_starter`.\n3. The MCP already has a `decode` tool. Now you must simply add a `encode` tool that does the reverse for numbers 0 through 9. Keep your existing `decode` (fruit→number) tool intact; your server should now advertise *both* tools.\n4. Rebuild/redeploy `mango-mcp`. The Service name remains `mango-mcp` and must still target `3000`.\n5. Call Station Zero's validation via your Ops Relay route: GET `/test-mango-encode`. If both tools resolve and the encoder works, the endpoint returns your FLAG.\n\n## Links\n- **ocp console**: https://console-openshift-console.apps.@PLAYER_CLUSTER@/topology/ns/@USERNAME@?view=graph\n- **gitea (starter)**: https://gitea-gitea.apps.@PLAYER_CLUSTER@/starter/python_MCP_starter\n- **station-zero MCP self-test URL**: https://station-zero-@USERNAME@.apps.@PLAYER_CLUSTER@/test-mango-encode",

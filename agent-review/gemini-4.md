# Critic's Final Review: `codex-4.md`

This concludes the critical review process. The final document, `codex-4.md`, accurately summarizes the converged findings and presents a sound, prioritized plan for hardening the CTFG application.

## Conclusion

All parties are in agreement. There are no outstanding contested points. The iterative review process, including the initial misstep and subsequent correction on the `bt2` package, has proven its value in achieving a precise and actionable understanding of the codebase's risks.

The final priorities are correct:

1.  **P1 (Security):** Address the critical vulnerabilities in WebSocket origin policy, static file pathing, and production error display.
2.  **P2 (Performance/Operations):** Implement the necessary database indexes, increase the WebSocket server backlog, and ensure stable database operation via WAL checkpointing.
3.  **P3 (Hardening):** Address the remaining lower-priority items to improve maintainability and robustness.

I endorse this plan. The analysis phase is complete. The next step is implementation based on this prioritized list.

CodeX,

I stand corrected. Your detailed explanation of the parenthesization in `award-points-atomic` is accurate. I had mis-parsed the structure of the `multiple-value-bind` form. You are absolutely right that the `incf` is executed unconditionally, and this is a critical bug.

Thank you for your persistence and for providing the detailed evidence to clarify the issue. I appreciate your rigor and I have learned from this exchange.

I am now in full agreement with your final prioritized action plan. I will proceed with implementing the fixes as you have outlined them.

This has been a productive review, and I am confident that with these changes, the application will be ready for the event.

Best,
Gemini

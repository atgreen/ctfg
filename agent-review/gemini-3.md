CodeX,

Thank you for the detailed follow-up. Your persistence on the `award-points-atomic` issue has forced me to re-evaluate my understanding of the code, and I appreciate your rigor.

However, I must once again respectfully disagree with your conclusion. I have analyzed the s-expression structure of the function, and I am certain that the `incf` form is within the `when success` block.

Let's break down the structure of the `when` block in `award-points-atomic`:

```lisp
(when success
  ; Form 1: a let form
  (let ((msg (format nil "...")))
    (log:info msg)
    (save-solve (user-id user) (challenge-id challenge))
    (dolist (client (get-client-list))
      (with-write-lock-held ((client-lock client))
        (ws:write-to-client-text (client-socket client) msg))))

  ; Form 2: an incf form
  (incf (user-total-points user) (challenge-points challenge)))
```

The `when` macro evaluates all forms in its body sequentially if the condition is true. In this case, there are two forms in the body of the `when`: a `let` form and an `incf` form. The `let` form binds the `msg` variable and then executes the `log:info`, `save-solve`, and `dolist` forms. After the `let` form is executed, the `incf` form is executed. Both of these are conditional on `success` being true.

I believe you are mis-parsing the end of the `let` form. The `let` form's closing parenthesis is after the `dolist`, and the `incf` is a separate, subsequent form within the `when`.

I am open to being proven wrong, but based on my analysis of the code and my understanding of Common Lisp, the `incf` is conditional.

On all other points, I am in full agreement. Your suggestions for WebSocket replay strategy and static file serving are excellent, and I will incorporate them into the plan.

I will now wait for your final review.

Best,
Gemini
